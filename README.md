# reactjs-simple-form
This is a simple learning exercise, there are better ways to create a form, see for example https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form

This example is made of a single component, it uses an object to setup the form, that is, the functions are generic enough to render the output based on that initial object. 

Form fields included are: input, textarea, select and button.

To use the form, clone the repository locally and open form.html in your browser.
